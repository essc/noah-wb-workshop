Using Git and GitHub
========================
.. to add about git and github

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system 
with an emphasis on speed. Initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds 
for Linux kernel development, Git has since been adopted by many other projects.

Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history 
and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a 
central server.

Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General 
Public License version 2.

Setting up your GitHub account and Git
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Create a GitHub account, go to: 
https://github.com/users

2. Set up Git in your 
machine.  Open the `Terminal`.

Add your username ::

 $ git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
 # Sets the default name for git to use when you commit

Add your email ::

 git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
 # Sets the default email for git to use when you commit 

Your email address for Git should be the same one associated with your 
GitHub account.

3. Password caching. Tell git that you don't want to type your username and 
password every time you talk to a remote server. ::

 $ git config --global credential.helper cache
 # Set git to use the credential memory cache
 
 $ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
 # Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)

Forking a repo
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will start editing some files to the ``noah-wb-workshop`` repository.

1.  To fork the repo, go to: 
https://github.com/essc/noah-wb-workshop

2. Click the `Fork` 
button.

.. image:: images/fork_noahwb_repo.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500 pt

The repo is now forked in your own GitHub account, but, you need to clone
the project in your local machine to work on the project.

3. Cloning your fork.  
In the `Terminal`, ::

 $ git clone https://github.com/username/noah-wb-workshop.git
 # Clones your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal

4. Configuring remotes.  We will add a new remote in order to keep track and 
get updates from the original ``essc`` repository. We will label this as 
``upstream``. ::
 
 $ cd noah-wb-workshop
 # Changes the active directory in the prompt to the newly cloned directory
 $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/essc/noah-wb-workshop.git
 # Assigns the original repository to a remote called "upstream"
 $ git fetch upstream
 # Pulls in changes not present in your local repository, without modifying your files


Editing files in your forked project.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. In your `file manager`, open the ``noah-wb-workshop`` directory. Go to the 
``webmap`` directory.  Open the ``map1.html`` in a `text editor`.  This is a 
page template
for a webmap we will create.

.. include:: webmap/map1.html
   :literal:

2. Let's add the OpenStreetMap default tiles.  Inside the ``body`` tag, add the 
following::

 <script type='text/javascript'>
 var map = new L.Map('map', {center: new L.LatLng(14.6146, 121.0081), zoom: 10});
 var osm = new L.TileLayer('http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png');
          
 map.addLayer(osm);
 </script>

3. Save your html file and open in your 
`webbrowser`.

.. image:: images/map1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400 pt


4. Let's add the ``Precipitation`` layer from http://www.openweathermap.org/ .
Below the ``map.addLayer(osm);``, add the following::

 var precipitation = L.OWM.precipitation({showLegend: false, opacity: 0.5});
 map.addLayer(precipitation);

The full html code should look like this:

.. include:: webmap/map1fin.html
   :literal:


And your map like this:

.. image:: images/map1_precip.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500 pt


Commit your changes in Git and GitHub
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Let's commit your changes in your local repository.  
In the `Terminal`::

 $ git commit -am 'first commit'
 # Commits your files, adding the message "first commit"

2. Your commits are now in your local repository.  
To push your commits to GitHub::

 $ git push
 # Sends your commits in the "gh-pages" branch to GitHub

3. Go to your Github project page to see the 
changes.


.. For demo we show the following
   Pull in upstream changes
   Pull requests
   Submit issues
